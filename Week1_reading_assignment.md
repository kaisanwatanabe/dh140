This week, I read an article which focused on attempts to discover Twitter users who may have MDD (major depressive disorder). 
Twitter was chosen as the platform of choice because people’s tweets are able to circulate past one’s following list and be seen by many other people.
In doing so, it is easier for people to find relatability in a large community. 
Twitter was also shown to provide meaningful data for clinical studies on depression in the past by NYU's Social Research and Public Policy Department 
(see Depressive moods of users portrayed in Twitter by Minsu Park, Chiyoung Cha, Meeyoung Cha). 
After sampling the data, and contacting a sample of the returned data, it was found that 404 out of the 448 users are true MDD users. 
From there estimates were made to see how frequently users from different areas would tweet about depression in the context of themselves. 
The study concluded that in general, districts with a higher population of people who are not high school educated have a higher rate of MDD users. 
The number goes up further for the rate of non-college educated populations. 
Lastly, middle-class people with a median household income at around 60,000 dollars have a higher prevalence of depression, 
and white communities tend to have a higher MDD rate in general.

This article is insightful to me because I am interested in the mental health rates of young age demographics. 
Using social media as a tool to track such age demographics seems like a very effective and intriguing method,
especially because I often use twitter to talk about my feelings knowing that my voice is both anonymous and widespread. 
I think the method in which they accumulated the data was very clever, using techniques such as text mining while still 
making sure to hand sort most of the data and actually go so far as to reach out to users to confirm their accuracy. 
This dataset also provides links to related studies of depression on using social media, so it is a good reference point to other studies. 
Understanding this data will also help me tailor my research towards causes of depression that most affect people in young age demographics, 
which I can add as more spatial data.
