I think the notion of a utopian system where everyone passively contributes to the development of history through the lens of their cultural and personal background
is indeed something that everyone aspires to create. I specifically, always am looking for ways to create artwork where people can express themselves as
dynamically and fluidly as possible. One of the reasons I was drawn to digital humanities in the first place is because of such reasons. That is the 
ability to use technology to gather the humane perspectives of historical events, and view them in an accessible fashion. I was particularly interested in the way 
Hypercities represented tweets by Egyptians during the Egyptian revolution. The frequency at which tweets appear seem to mimic the voices of the people echoesing 
throughout the city of Cairo, and although a passive experience, can be incredibly thought provoking and inspiring. The location in which the tweets appear also help 
to quickly address the bias in the demographic of Egyptian twitter users, which is useful for conducting further investigation. Both in the cases of Iran, and Egypt,
hypercities helped to easily visualize and communicate the volume and geographical breathe of the revolution through geographically placed voices of twitter. I am
curious to ask "is there a way in which hypercities can be used to communicate the narrative between users of opposing opinions over social media?". As conversations
on Twitter are usually a back and forth discourse, I think it would be telling to understand where the users creating such users are tweeting from, and at what time.
Understanding the geographic location in which users reside contexualizes their conversation, allowing us to make connections as to how the community where they live or 
the physical disasters that they have faced can lead to the development of such opinons.
