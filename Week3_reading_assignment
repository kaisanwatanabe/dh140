OpenStreetMaps is without a doubt a large contributor to mapping underserviced locations that provide a solution to large corporate businesses controlling knowledge
on geospatial data. I really appreciated Rachel going through the community driven aspects of the OpenStreetMaps project, as using geolocated data to help 
commmunities in need was one of my primary reasons for being interested in Digital Humanitites in the first place.

As a a participant of the 2020 mapathon, I was able to take part in the mapping aspect of the project by mapping about 250 buildings.
Although I was happy to be able to contribute to the OpenStreetMaps project, I wish that I could recieve feedback on my mapping efforts as well.
I think that understanding whether or not my maps were beneficial to more experienced mappers, and most importantly the community members, will help me both become
a better mapper and be more motivated to do so.
