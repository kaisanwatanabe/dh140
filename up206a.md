Hi, my name is Kai. I'm a senior at UCLA majoring in DMA, and enjoy creating artwork, coding, and learning about philosphy and psychology. I took interest in this class because I wanted to learn about the technical process of creating digital maps, and what social and cultural influences they can have in the world. I'm specifically interested in collecting data about causes of mental health, and the demographics of people most affected across multiple age groups. I would like to focus on the US for starters, but would be interested in focusing in on Japanese culture too. In the end, I hope to at least gain an understanding of how to collect, tailor, and code data so that it can be visualized in a logical and aesthetic fashion.
